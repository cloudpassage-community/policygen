# Created by Brian Adams, DevOps Contractor, 2016.
# Set the enabled group names to apply for user. Set group definitions below based 
# on current template. Currently no verification and rule added whether or not 
# there are duplicates in existing policy, so set inactive and verify first. 

# When setting rule to active, all rules that match the comment string will be
# set to active. Comments are NOT wildcards and have to be explicit.

# Any values set in "groups" will override values set in specified rule set.

# A group with the name of "qa" with wildcard enabled will match all policies with name in portal,
# like qa test, qa staging, qa cassandra, etc. With wildcard disabled will only match "qa."
# Doing a dry run to see which policies will change is highly recommended.
